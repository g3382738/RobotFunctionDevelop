VoxForge & Julius Quick Start.

This Tar file contains everything you need to get Julius working:
 * Julius Run-time engine executable;
 * VoxForge Acoustic Model files;
 * VoxForge sample Grammar files.

Simply extract the gzipped tar file to a directory, and execute the following command:
 
 $./julius -input mic -C Sample.jconf

For information on the Julius grammar syntax, see the enclosed GRAMMAR_NOTES.

We still need much more speech to create decent quality Acoustic Models.  So 
please take the time to submit some transcribed speech to www.voxforge.org.

thanks,

the VoxForge team.
